# promise
A look a different promise architecture implementations. There are a lot of options out there, so let's take a look at some of the options. As we get started remember this. There are really 2 ways of dealing with promises, the [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/) way and the [Kris Kowal](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) way.

To see any of these example in action head over to [http://promise-blog.azurewebsites.net/](http://promise-blog.azurewebsites.net/). You will just need to paste on the root you want to look at. If you want to see ES6 promises in action goto [http://promise-blog.azurewebsites.net/promise-es6/](http://promise-blog.azurewebsites.net/promise-es6/).

## Non-promise Based Architecture
1 `callback` provides a tightly coupled modular communication architecture
2 `messaging` provides a loosely coupled module communication architecture

## Demos
The `demos` folder provides the basics for interacting with geolocation and for writing a module based on the Revealing Module Pattern. It also gives an example of how to combine those concepts together.
